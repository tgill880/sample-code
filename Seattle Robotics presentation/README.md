## Seattle Robotics Society presentation
This is the talk I gave to the Seattle Robotics Society on measuring speaker cabinet vibrations
with an Arduino UNO and a digital accelerometer.

The Physics class paper and souce code are in the [`sample-code/cabinet-tester`](https://github.com/tgill880/sample-code/tree/master/cabinet-tester) directory.
